# Dataform Training

This training is prepared to work on the public GitHub commit repository.

In order to start working with the repo, please review the dataform configuration `dataform.json`
and replace `defaultDatabase` value to your GCP project_id, `defaultLocation` to your region_id and `defaultSchema` to your dataform output dataset, and finally 
`assertionSchema` to the dataset where the assertions will be published.
